&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Jorge, and I am one of the selected students for this GSOC
edition at poliastro under the OpenAstronomy organization. I started working on
poliastro project after Juanlu came to my university to give a talk about Open
Source software in engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After forking poliastro, I decided to improve API Docs, which gave me an
overview on how the project was built and how the different modules talked
among them. I had no idea on how Git and GitHub worked and therefore,
when finished with the docs my first pull request was quite massive...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after that I started feeling more confortable with GitHub and Sphinx, the
tool used nowadays in poliastro for building documentation. Then, I decided to
work on a porkchop plotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the week after …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="GSOC"></category><category term="GSOC19"></category><category term="poliastro"></category></entry><entry><title>GSoC'18: improving propagators, adding natural and artificial perturbations at Poliastro</title><link href="https://blog.poliastro.space/2018/08/05/2018-08-05-google-summer-of-code-2018/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-05T14:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-05T14:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Nikita Astrakhantsev</name></author><id>tag:blog.poliastro.space,2018-08-05:2018/08/05/2018-08-05-google-summer-of-code-2018/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a lazy Sunday at home and nothing prepared me for my girlfriend giving me the link for the GSoC'18 announcement page. I was considering participation a year ago, but had not enough resoluteness for that. This year I wanted it to be different so I started scrolling through the list of open-source organisations. As I am doing a PhD in theoretical physics now (defending in January 2019), I wanted the project to be scientific, not just some boring back-end development (in which I am anyway not strong enough). After a couple of iterations I converged to three space-aimed organisations. What shocked me, was the fact that mostly people of these organizations were not eager to even answer simple questions or it took them a week to provide a dataset for analysis. Only in Poliastro it was easy enough …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="GSoC"></category><category term="poliastro"></category></entry></feed>
